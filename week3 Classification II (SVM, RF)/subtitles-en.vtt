00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.610
This is David Forsyth from the University of Illinois and

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.680
we're going to do the linear support vector machine in this movie.

3
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.985
So we need a classification rule and I'm going to make the apparently arbitrary,

4
00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:22.195
and it may even seem to you unwise decision,

5
00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:26.660
to choose a classifier of the following form.

6
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.200
I have binary data.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.085
There are n pairs of data items,

8
00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:32.890
x_i is a feature vector,

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.720
y_i is the ith class label.

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.615
And I will assume that y_i is either 1 or -1.

11
00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:43.295
Then to predict the sign of y_i for any point x,

12
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.655
we use a linear classifier.

13
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.590
And for any new data item,

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.632
I will predict the sign of a transpose x plus B.

15
00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:55.910
Now, of course the issue here is choosing a and

16
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.381
b such that we get good behavior on future data.

17
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.380
Now the first thing to think about is,

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.890
what does the rule mean?

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.570
So here's a really easy example,

20
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.500
I've got an alien trying to tell males from females.

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.450
The alien looks at height,

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.040
the alien can see there's feature x,

23
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.220
the height and it predicts male or female as sign of a_x plus B.

24
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.860
What is it doing?

25
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.135
Well basically there's some point minus b over a.

26
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:36.830
If the height is bigger than that point it makes one prediction,

27
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.875
if the height is smaller than that point it makes another prediction.

28
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.635
So, on this side,

29
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.050
a times height plus b is positive,

30
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.380
on that side a times height plus b is negative or

31
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.215
the other way round and I'll map those to male and female and I'm done.

32
00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.110
So here's the second version, more interesting,

33
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.764
the alien now has two features.

34
00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:58.600
So it's a two dimensional feature vector x and

35
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.110
the alien is looking at a transpose x plus b.

36
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.235
Now the rules of linear algebra tell me that a is two dimensional as well.

37
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:11.685
The sign changes where a transpose x plus b equals zero.

38
00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:13.760
You should know that this is a line.

39
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.635
x is a two dimensional variable.

40
00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:25.302
I can think about my 2D vector x as a little x coordinate and a little y coordinate.

41
00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:26.620
And if you expand this out,

42
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.740
you're going to get an equation that looks like something times

43
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.155
x plus something times y plus a constant equals zero.

44
00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.125
You can check that that makes a line.

45
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.045
So my alien now,

46
00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:43.067
operating in two dimensions,

47
00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:46.355
has a bunch of data.

48
00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:54.730
Let's write pluses for one category,

49
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.135
minuses for the other category,

50
00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:05.318
what my alien is doing is choosing a line that separates those two categories.

51
00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:11.630
In this case plus on that side and minus on that side.

52
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.080
Now what should occur to you is

53
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.290
two concerns which basically occur to everybody at this stage.

54
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.570
One is, this linear model might very well seem to you to be too simple.

55
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.050
Why? Because if you expend a little imagination on it,

56
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.775
you can easily draw datasets where a linear model isn't going to help you very much.

57
00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:35.805
Your intuition is misleading you there and I'll draw some pictures now.

58
00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:38.930
In fact, a strategy that says if it's not working,

59
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.200
make the feature vector bigger, is very good.

60
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.390
There are some possible constructions but typically you just

61
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.520
add features and I'll show you an example in a second.

62
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.550
The next question you could ask is,

63
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.360
look, this is a really simple model.

64
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.060
Why do you expect it to work well?

65
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.910
And the answer is, I don't have to estimate a lot of

66
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.805
complicated parameters so I'm more likely to get accurate values.

67
00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:03.980
Let's go over the linear model is too simple example, our question.

68
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.195
So let me go back to my alien.

69
00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:14.770
As you recall, the alien was trying to tell male from female thinking about height.

70
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.120
So I'll draw that axis for

71
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.630
the height variable and we've got the examples in one dimension,

72
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.060
so he's got a bunch of female examples over here.

73
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.730
It turns out that human females tend to be less tall than human males,

74
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.800
so we sort of expect and mostly would see data distributions that look a bit like this.

75
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.446
The taller ones tend to be male or the males tend to be taller,

76
00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:46.514
the females tend to be shorter but you're not guaranteed,

77
00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:49.120
there are some short males and some tall females.

78
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.485
What my alien could do is say, let me add a feature.

79
00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:55.910
Now for that, we want a second drawing.

80
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.635
The alien, being a well-informed sort of alien as aliens are,

81
00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:07.945
adds another relatively simple feature and the feature is the number of y chromosomes.

82
00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:11.780
So here is height and

83
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.765
here is the number of y chromosomes which mostly is either zero or one.

84
00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:19.250
There's some other odd cases but we'll ignore those.

85
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.890
The deal here is that the males always

86
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.510
have one y chromosome and they tend to be a bit tall,

87
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.847
so I'll put them over here,

88
00:05:31.847 --> 00:05:36.170
and the females always have zero y chromosomes.

89
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.200
Again we're leaving out some genetically slightly odd cases.

90
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.540
Usually it's not a particularly good idea to have

91
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.930
more than one or fewer than zero y chromosomes and

92
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.979
if you do I'm afraid I'm not talking about you.

93
00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.480
Now, my alien has no problem at all.

94
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.085
By inserting one feature,

95
00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:56.255
he can choose or,

96
00:05:56.255 --> 00:06:00.825
the alien can choose a line that separates these two populations just fine thank you.

97
00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:02.410
For example that line.

98
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.270
Now this principle operates more generally.

99
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.455
Here's another possible example that might worry you.

100
00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:10.555
Many people come up with this one.

101
00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:15.343
Here's a two dimensional data set that would be really difficult,

102
00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:22.210
where it would be really difficult to separate the pluses and

103
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:30.099
the minuses with a line.

104
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.274
Now what am I going to do about that?

105
00:06:32.274 --> 00:06:36.110
The sensible answer always is add more features.

106
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.910
So what I could do is add a simple feature and the simple feature is going to

107
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.061
be distance of a data point from the origin.

108
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.870
Now we could plot

109
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.675
the new three dimensional dataset or I suppose you could visualize it without a plot.

110
00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:57.095
But let me try and plot it because I think it's drawable.

111
00:06:57.095 --> 00:07:00.130
What am I going to see?

112
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:08.690
Well my pluses are close to the origin so they're going to be low in this new future.

113
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.653
My minuses however, are rather far from the origin.

114
00:07:12.653 --> 00:07:21.095
So they're going to be up here floating around on some large radius plane.

115
00:07:21.095 --> 00:07:26.490
And I should be able to separate these two by

116
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:33.721
a plane that looks at the distance from the origin.

117
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.620
So mostly, if you're in trouble with

118
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.750
a linear rule like this if you add features, you'll get out of trouble.

119
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.480
So we're just not going to worry about

120
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.625
this question of the rule being too simple because it isn't.

121
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:48.090
That brings us to a small piece of terminology.

122
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.935
A support vector machine is a linear classifier trained with the hinge loss.

123
00:07:53.935 --> 00:08:02.850
When I say linear classifier I mean a classifier that does sign of a transpose x plus b.

124
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.205
They're usually called SVMs.

125
00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:08.490
There are a variety of other things you can do that are also

126
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.466
called SVMs but predominantly,

127
00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:15.250
that, trained with a hinge loss, is an SVM.
