This is David Forsyth from the University of Illinois.

2
00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:07.522
Let's do a sum. Here, split one.

3
00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:15.588
Here, split two, and I'm interested in the entropy of a label,

4
00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:21.605
condition on no split minus

5
00:00:21.605 --> 00:00:29.265
the entropy of the label, condition on split.

6
00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.087
It's two split one.

7
00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.570
Okay, so let me compute the entropy of label given no split.

8
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:45.220
Well, given no split P of X is three over five.

9
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.530
So H of label condition on no split will

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:59.225
be minus three of the five log three of the five,

11
00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:06.240
minus two of the five, log, two over five.

12
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.321
I computed that on my calculator which for some reason wouldn't do log two so I computed

13
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:17.370
it in knots rather than bits and I got .67.

14
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.745
Now, H of label condition on split is more interesting.

15
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:25.725
So, if I have a split,

16
00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:28.929
I don't know which side I'm going to go onto.

17
00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.100
So, I have to think about P of left and P of right.

18
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.645
P of left is going to be two over five.

19
00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:48.990
Just by I. P of right is three over five and H should label

20
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.725
given split is going to be H of label given left times two over

21
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:01.635
five plus H of

22
00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:09.560
label given R times three over five.

23
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.800
Now all this is simplified a little bit because H of label

24
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.930
conditioned on the left is zero.

25
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.045
Why? Because if you go left, you know what the label is.

26
00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.827
And the label is X. So this is zero.

27
00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:25.990
And H of label given right is again,

28
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.350
fairly easy to compute,

29
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.780
that is going to be minus one third log one over three minus two thirds,

30
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.555
log two over three.

31
00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:48.645
This expression H of label condition on split is going to be .65.

32
00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:53.355
So, my total information gain is going to be.02.

33
00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:56.300
If you push through the same calculation, again, in nought,

34
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.820
because I only had a lin on my calculator, for side two,

35
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.705
the information gained is going to be .01,

36
00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:07.825
rather than .02 nought.

37
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.290
And by I, that seems feeling natural.

38
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.840
Side one, if I go left,

39
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.860
I'm in really good shape.

40
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.190
If I go right, I'm about as good shape as I was.

41
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.015
Side two, if I go right, I'm clueless.

42
00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:25.000
If I get left, I'm in about as good shape as I would so one looks better than two.
